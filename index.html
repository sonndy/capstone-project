                            <p class="fifth-section-paragraph">Technology is completely changing the education field, now because of technology teachers and professors can optimize the way they provide their content to their students. Teachers can use a variety of apps, and technology devices to boost engagement in the classroom (Lynch, 2020). This field combining technology and education together has been called, “education technology.” Not only does this form of technology allow people to learn anywhere in the world, but it also creates a new form of learning called asynchronous learning. Which allows students to go at their own pace when learning new information. One of the most important aspect technologies provide to educators is that it allows them keep organize progress of the students, and the students can access their information whenever they want to (Lynch, 2020). Moreover, students can gain much more from their education since they can use the internet to do in depth research on topics pertaining to the course.  </p>

These issues are misinformation, disinformation, and confirmation bias (Global News, 2019). If these problems keep persisting, they could have long lasting negative effects on our society. Fake news and misinformation are becoming rampant in our society, online it has becoming extremely hard to distinguish real from fake, people can no longer believe what they see, online without questioning if it’s fake. <br><br> Furthermore, the reach and viral nature of social media platforms enable fake news and misinformation to spread faster than usual. Much research shows that misinformation can fuel chaos, confusion, and violence in countries that have political conflicts. The rise of misinformation and disinformation has led many experts to believe that it is a serious issue in digital spaces that might have a huge impact on the digital world (Vogels et al., 2020). </p>
