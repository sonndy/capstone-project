                        <p>Technology has made society progress at a rapid rate, innovations that used to be impossible a few decades ago are now possible thanks to technology. The rise of the information age has completely changed how and to whom we can communicate with. Due to how powerful software and hardware have become in recent years, society is able to make great strides in important sectors such as healthcare, business, and education. Despite the overwhelming positive benefits of technology, it also exacerbates many problems that society was already facing, forcing many individuals to step back and objectively analyze the unintended consequences that technology is having on our society. This multimedia story will take an in depth look at how technology is a useful tool, and that the many effects that it has on society is simply caused by how people use the technology.</p>

                            <p class="third-section-paragraph">Technology has been one of the most revolutionary things that happen in the business world, it not only improving many processes that make a business run more efficient, it also open new ways for people to communicate with each other. One of the most important things that technology improve is the communication aspect of business. Since most businesses are hierarchical in nature their core aspect of involve interacting with people and building relationships with them, the digital world has made this easier than ever. Moreover, business have a huge amount of data that they need to store to maintain and improve their services, thanks to technology they can use “minimal resources consumed in processing business activities, allowing room for better products produced and faster services delivered to more clients and customers” (The role of technology in business, 2021). Business was already a complex web of process that involve many interconnected parts such as communication, transportations, and many other layers, technology has completely changed that complex process, and create something that is more manageable and scalable to the upper management (EBM Team, 2019). Technology has revolutionized business models and concepts and making business more profitable than ever.  </p>

                            <p class="fifth-section-paragraph">Technology is completely changing the education field, now because of technology teachers and professors can optimize the way they provide their content to their students. Teachers can use a variety of apps, and technology devices to boost engagement in the classroom (Lynch, 2020). This field combining technology and education together has been called, “education technology.” Not only does this form of technology allow people to learn anywhere in the world, but it also creates a new form of learning called asynchronous learning. Which allows students to go at their own pace when learning new information. One of the most important aspect technologies provide to educators is that it allows them keep organize progress of the students, and the students can access their information whenever they want to (Lynch, 2020). Moreover, students can gain much more from their education since they can use the internet to do in depth research on topics pertaining to the course.  </p>

One of the problems that arise is privacy. Today a lot of technology devices are data driven which mean that they collect data from their users to make their services better. In this research by Pew Research Center, I learn how those data driven technologies have left people feeling concerned and confused over how little control they have over their personal information (Auxier et al., 2017). This has led to some pretty pessimistic views regarding users' privacy. The main points of the research were that six-ten-Americans believe that it is not possible to go through daily without having their data being collected, and how most Americans feel that they have little control over what data about them is being collected by companies and the government. </p>

These issues are misinformation, disinformation, and confirmation bias (Global News, 2019). If these problems keep persisting, they could have long lasting negative effects on our society. Fake news and misinformation are becoming rampant in our society, online it has becoming extremely hard to distinguish real from fake, people can no longer believe what they see, online without questioning if it’s fake. Furthermore, the reach and viral nature of social media platforms enable fake news and misinformation to spread faster than usual. Much research shows that misinformation can fuel chaos, confusion, and violence in countries that have political conflicts. The rise of misinformation and disinformation has led many experts to believe that it is a serious issue in digital spaces that might have a huge impact on the digital world (Vogels et al., 2020). </p>

                        <p>After taking a more in depth look on the effect that technology have on society, I’ve come to the conclusion that ultimately technology is just a tool, the effects that it has on society is simply caused by human behavior, and that despite the usefulness of the technology there is always a possibility it might have unintended consequences. That is why the creators of new innovation must always think what social implication that their technology might have on society. As someone who is currently learning about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC),  an application standard that many companies used to build software I believe that expert in the technology field should come together to add a new stage to that development cycle that added a social informatic aspect to it. This new stage of the SDLC would allowed the creators of the software to get together and discuss how human behaviors might completely change and distorted the way they were expecting their technology to behave. This will not only give them time to think of the negatives effects of their technology might have on the world, but they will also be able to proactively create laws that stop the bad actors before they started.</p>
